Important:

Make "rename" file dialoge use a proper GUI and not a command shell prompt
Find bugs and fix them (there are a decent amount if i remember)

Kinda important:
Duplicate / copy and paste folders (only renaming works with folders rn)

Cool upgrades:
Images are displayed in the program, without opening it externally (same for music maybe too)

Maybe:
Mobile support?? (maybe possible
